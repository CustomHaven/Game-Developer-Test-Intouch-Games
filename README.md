### General Information
This is the main repository for the Game Development challenge test.

Visit https://aback-ship.surge.sh/ to play the game.

Visit [main.ts](https://github.com/CustomHaven/Intouch-Game-Developer_Technical-Test/blob/master/main.ts) to see the code for the game.


### Technologies

- HTML5 - Canvas
- JavaScript - (not used but its bundled from tsconfig.json)
- Typescript

### Mission
---
The game must be written using strongly-typed Typescript and displayed using HTML5 Canvas. Make full use of OOP principles and do not use the DOM instead draw directly inside the Canvas.

### HTML5 - Canvas
---
We have a Canvas element where we draw into it and make our game. So we do not have access to the DOM anymore when working inside the canvas from our Typescript file.

### Javascript
---
We did not write the Javascript as it is bundled and created by [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/CustomHaven/Intouch-Game-Developer_Technical-Test/blob/master/tsconfig.json).
But the Javascript [main.js](https://github.com/CustomHaven/Intouch-Game-Developer_Technical-Test/blob/master/main.js) is needed to be referenced inside the source tag of the HTML file.

As at the end of the day Typescript is still just Javascript but more powerful and has type checking implicitly and we can write the type explicitly which makes it better and less prone to errors. 


### Typescript
---

Typescript is a superset of Javascript. It enables us to add types to regular Javascript. And also checks for syntax error before runtime. It also has tooltips that shows why some code might throw an error, which helps in reducing valuable time in debugging and finding the error/bug.

We utilized our use of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) where we made several classes. And this is great because it saves us from having to repeat ourselves in building the same object over and over again.

As we have several classes and with the help of Typescript strongly typed explicit types we have no errors in the code.

We built our game inside the Canvas element. When working inside the canvas element, you do not have access to the DOM anymore and the work gets a bit more trickier as it will involve some Mathematics in order to achieve what we want.
